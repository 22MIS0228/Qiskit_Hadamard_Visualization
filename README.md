# Hadamard Gate Visualization (Qiskit 2.x)

A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the Hadamard (H) gate on single and multiple qubits using Qiskit 2.x with visualizations like Bloch sphere, statevector city plot, and measurement histograms. Includes student practice tasks for learning quantum concepts.

---

## Features

- Single-Qubit Hadamard Gate
- Two-Qubit Hadamard (H⊗H)
- Bell State Generation (H + CNOT)
- Visualizations: Bloch sphere, statevector city plot, measurement histogram

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Qiskit 2.x
- Qiskit Aer simulator

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer
```

---

## How to Use

1. Open `Hadamard_Visualization.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run all cells to see visualizations and measurement results.
3. Modify input states or qubits to explore different scenarios.

---

## Student Practice Tasks

1. Predict the statevector after H on |0>, |1>, |+>, |->.
2. Create a 3-qubit system with H⊗H⊗H and analyze measurement probabilities.
3. Apply H + CX + CX on 3 qubits and analyze correlations.
4. Apply H twice on |1> and verify the original state.
5. Use Bloch sphere plots to observe qubit rotations after Hadamard.
